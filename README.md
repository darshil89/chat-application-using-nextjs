## **Overview**

🔍 I developed a real-time chat application, gaining expertise in web development and real-time communication technologies. The app features Google Authentication for secure and convenient user sign-in, allowing users to easily access their accounts. It supports instant friend requests, enabling users to connect with each other quickly.

Key functionalities include real-time chatting for seamless conversations and chat room creation and invitation, allowing users to organize group discussions. To optimize performance, I leveraged Redis for efficient data caching and utilized Upstash for enhanced data management. Additionally, real-time friend requests are managed using Redis, ensuring prompt and efficient handling of connection requests.
